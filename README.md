# GPS-Tracking-System
ESP32 Microcontroller, NEO 8M GPS Module, Arduino IDE, Mosquitto, Ngrok and IoT  MQTT Panel.

The GPS tracking system is a compact and efficient device designed to provide real-time location data for various applications. The system comprises two main components: the ESP32 microcontroller and the NEO 8M GPS module. The ESP32 microcontroller is responsible for processing and transmitting the location data, while the NEO 8M GPS module provides precise location information using Global Positioning System (GPS) technology.

 GPS tracking system uses secure communication protocols, such as MQTT, to ensure that the location data is transmitted safely and efficiently. The device also uses Ngrok, a secure tunneling service, to enable remote access to the GPS tracker's data, allowing users to access the device's data from anywhere in the world.
